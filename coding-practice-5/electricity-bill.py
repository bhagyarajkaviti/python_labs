#In this problem, you need to write a program to calculate the electricity bill for a household, based on the units of electricity the household consumed. The price for unit varies based on the slab.
#The charges per unit for different slabs are as mentioned below:
    #For the first 50 units (0-50), the charge is 2/unit
    #For the next 100 units (51-150), the charge is 3/unit
    #For the next 100 units (151-250), the charge is 5/unit
    #For above 250 units (251 and above), the charge is 8/unit
#Apart from these charges, there is also an additional surcharge of 20% on the total amount is added to the bill.
